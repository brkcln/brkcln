# Hey, I'm Burak 👋

Full-stack developer building SaaS platforms, CRMs, and internal tools with **Laravel** and **Vue/Nuxt**.

Based in Turkey, working remotely with distributed teams.

### What I Do

I build and maintain production web applications — mostly multi-tenant SaaS products, admin dashboards, and CRM systems. I've been doing this for 4+ years, working with startups and small teams.

Some things I've built:

- 🎵 **Music Distribution SaaS** — Artist payouts, subscriptions, reporting dashboards (500+ users)
- 💬 **Health CRM** — Omnichannel chat integrating WhatsApp, Telegram, and Facebook in one inbox
- 🚌 **Bus Ticket SaaS** — Dynamic pricing, route management, multi-tenant architecture
- 🏪 **Marketplace Platform** — Craigslist-style listings with geolocation, filters, and messaging
- 🤖 **AI-Powered CMS** — Multi-tenant CMS with LangChain-based workflows

All live, all with real users.

### How I Work

- Comfortable stepping into existing codebases and legacy projects
- Async-first communication, experienced with Slack, ClickUp, and similar tools
- I ship clean, maintainable code — not just code that works
