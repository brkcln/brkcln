I build SaaS apps, CRMs, and dashboards with Laravel and Vue.
Been doing this for about 4 years, mostly with startups and small teams.

If your project is unfinished or you need someone to take over code from another developer, I can do that.
I step into existing projects quite often.

Some things I’ve built:
-A marketplace like Craigslist
-A CRM that connects WhatsApp and Telegram in one inbox
-A SaaS with dynamic pricing and an AI-powered CMS

All live, all with real users.
I do both frontend and backend, and I’m comfortable working with your team on Slack, ClickUp, or whatever you use.

Want to talk about your project? Just send a message.
